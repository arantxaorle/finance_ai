🧩 1. What Is a Stock?

Investing in stocks means buying shares of ownership in a company.
Each share represents a small piece of that company’s value and earnings.

When a company grows and becomes more profitable, the price of its stock often increases.
If the company performs poorly, the stock price can decrease.

Stock prices are influenced by:

Company earnings and performance

Market trends and investor sentiment

Broader economic conditions (interest rates, inflation, GDP growth)

Investors can earn money from stocks in two main ways:

Capital gains – when the price of the stock goes up and you sell at a higher price.

Dividends – when the company shares part of its profits with shareholders.

⚖️ 2. Diversification and Risk Management

Diversification is one of the most important principles in investing.
Instead of putting all your money into one company or one type of asset, you spread investments across different sectors and asset classes (like stocks, bonds, real estate, or ETFs).

This helps reduce risk because:

If one investment performs poorly, others may offset the loss.

It stabilizes returns over time and protects your portfolio during market downturns.

Example:

If you invest only in technology stocks, a tech market crash could cause major losses.
But if you also hold bonds, healthcare stocks, and index funds, your overall risk is lower.

📊 3. Understanding Valuation: The P/E Ratio

The P/E ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) is a common tool used to evaluate whether a stock is expensive or cheap relative to its earnings.

It is calculated as:

P/E = Stock Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)

A low P/E might mean the stock is undervalued or that investors expect slower growth.

A high P/E might mean the stock is overvalued or that investors expect strong future growth.

Always compare a company’s P/E ratio to:

Its industry average

Its own historical P/E

Broader market benchmarks

📦 4. ETFs and Index Funds

ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are baskets of assets (stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.) that trade on exchanges like stocks.
They allow investors to gain exposure to a wide range of assets with a single purchase.

Benefits of ETFs:

Diversification

Lower fees than mutual funds

Liquidity (you can buy or sell during market hours)

Example:

The S&P 500 ETF (ticker: SPY) tracks the performance of the 500 largest U.S. companies.
By buying one share of SPY, you’re indirectly investing in all 500 companies.

⏳ 5. Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance

Before investing, always consider your:

Risk tolerance – how much market volatility you can emotionally and financially handle.

Time horizon – how long you plan to keep your money invested.

Short-term trading can be profitable but carries higher risk.
Long-term investing (5+ years) benefits from compound growth and tends to smooth out short-term volatility.

Tip:

If you need the money soon, focus on safer assets like bonds or cash equivalents.
If you’re investing for retirement, long-term stock investments may offer higher returns.

🧭 6. Core Investing Principles

Invest regularly (dollar-cost averaging) instead of trying to time the market.

Reinvest dividends to compound your growth.

Keep fees and taxes as low as possible.

Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically.

Avoid emotional decisions — stick to your long-term plan.
